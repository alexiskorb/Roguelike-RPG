# Roguelike-RPG

This game is an ASCII roguelike RPG adventure.<br /> 
It was created in C++ with Visual Studio for my CS 32 class at UCLA.<br />
I programmed all of the code except for main.cpp, utilities.cpp, and the extra files added by Visual Studio.<br />

Notable Features:<br />
-Random dungeon generator: Creates the impression of a series of rooms connected by corridors.<br />
-Monster tracking: Different monsters will track and attack the player in different ways.<br />
-Inventory: Players can pickup, equip, and use different weapons and scrolls.<br />
